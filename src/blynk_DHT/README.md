# Blynk with DHT sensor on Wemos

## Requirements

#### The required libraries
* Blynk library: https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library

* DHT22 sensor: Adafruit unified sensor by Adafruit.  
(Install by ```Sketch->Include Library->Manage Libraries->adafruit unified sensor```)

* Simple Timer: https://github.com/schinken/SimpleTimer

* Adafruit Unified Sensor: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor/archive/master.zip
##### Two ways to install libraries:

1. Using library manager:  
The In the Arduino app go to Sketch -> Include Library -> Library Manager and search for ‘dht’. Install the first one that shows up; by Adafruit.  
2. Add .zip file:  
The SimpleTimer - This time download https://github.com/jfturcot/SimpleTimer/archive/master.zip and then go to Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library and choose the file you’ve just downloaded.
